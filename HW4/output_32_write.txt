Congratulations, you have gotten something working!

Now that you can wade through the FAT with the greatest of ease, you can
undercut all of those $30 shareware "Undelete" applications that market
to people with digital camera and USB drive dysfunctions.  Go forth and
take advantage of other people's misfortunes!

Only $19.99!!!!
