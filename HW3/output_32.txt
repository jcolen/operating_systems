Well folks the soaring season is upon us.  For the next two or
three weeks we can expect good conditions, with lift from 3,000
to 8,000 feet.  If you've always wanted to go up in a glider and
sustain with the eagles (and vultures), now is your chance.
On one weekend day each week (weather permitting) I'll take one
or two people up.  This opportunity will last as long as the
weather holds out.  Once the fall season is over, there will be
no more thermaling until April-May.

Mechanics:
	Email me by Friday afternoon each week.
		Leave your phone number. I'll call.

	Max weight 200 lbs.
	Min weight (front seat) 100lbs.
	Min weight (back seat) 00lbs.
	Front seat has the good view.
	Max height 6'8".

	You pay for tow to 3000', $20.
	I pay for the rest, aircraft time, insurance, etc.

	I'll call you and set up the time, expect an early 
	afternoon flight, leaving in the late morning, arriving
	home by 4PM.  I'll call on the departure morning to
	confirm in case of marginal (or bad) weather.

	If you are prone to motion sickness, or vertigo, please
	don't sign up.  It will be an unpleasant experience for
	both of us!

	The airport is in Waynesboro, on the other side of the
	Blue Ridge.  You will need to provide your own transport
	there, or at least as far as Greenwood.

Send me mail, and experience the thrill of riding an elevator
into the sky.

Andrew Grimshaw

Congratulations, you have gotten something working!

Now that you can wade through the FAT with the greatest of ease, you can
undercut all of those $30 shareware "Undelete" applications that market
to people with digital camera and USB drive dysfunctions.  Go forth and
take advantage of other people's misfortunes!

Only $19.99!!!!

-Duane

> Software - How Software Companies Die
>         By: Orson Scott Card
> 
> The environment that nutures creative programmers kills management
> and marketing types - and vice versa.  Programming is the Great Game.
> It consumes you, body and soul.  When you're caught up in it, nothing
> else matters.  When you emerge into daylight, you might well discover
> that you're a hundred pounds overweight, your underwear is older than
> the average first grader, and judging from the number of pizza boxes
> lying around, it must be spring already.  But you don't care, because
> your program runs, and the code is fast and clever and tight.  You won.
> You're aware that some people think you're a nerd.  So what?  They're
> not players.  They've never jousted with Windows or gone hand to hand
> with DOS. To them C++ is a decent grade, almost a B - not a language.
> They barely exist.  Like soldiers or artists, you don't care about the
> opinions of civilians.  You're building something intricate and fine.
> They'll never understand it.
> 
> BEEKEEPING
> 
> Here's the secret that every successful software company is based on:
> You can domesticate programmers the way beekeepers tame bees.  You
> can't exactly communicate with them, but you can get them to swarm in
> one place and when they're not looking, you can carry off the honey.
> You keep these bees from stinging by paying them money.  More money
> than they know what to do with.  But that's less than you might think.
> You see, all these programmers keep hearing their parents' voices in
> their heads saying "When are you going to join the real world?"  All
> you have to pay them is enough money that they can answer (also in
> their heads) "Geez, Dad, I'm making more than you."  On average, this
> is cheap.  And you get them to stay in the hive by giving them other
> coders to swarm with.  The only person whose praise matters is another
> programmer.  Less-talented programmers will idolize them; evenly
> matched ones will challenge and goad one another; and if you want to
> get a good swarm, you make sure that you have at least one certified
> genius coder that they can all look up to, even if he glances at other
> people's code only long enough to sneer at it. He's a Player, thinks
> the junior programmer.  He looked at my code.  That is enough. If a
> software company provides such a hive, the coders will give up sleep,
> love, health, and clean laundry, while the company keeps the bulk of
> the money.
> 
> OUT OF CONTROL
> 
> Here's the problem that ends up killing company after company.  All
> successful software companies had, as their dominant personality, a
> leader who nurtured programmers.  But no company can keep such a leader
> forever. Either he cashes out, or he brings in management types who end
> up driving him out, or he changes and becomes a management type himself.
> One way or another, marketers get control.  But...control of what?
> Instead of finding assembly lines of productive workers, they quickly
> discover that their product is produced by utterly unpredictable,
> uncooperative, disobedient, and worst of all, unattractive people who
> resist all attempts at management.  Put them on a time clock, dress
> them in suits, and they become sullen and start sabotaging the product.
> Worst of all, you can sense that they are making fun of you with every
> word they say.
> 
> SMOKED OUT
> 
> The shock is greater for the coder, though.  He suddenly finds that
> alien creatures control his life.  Meetings, Schedules, Reports.  And
> now someone demands that he PLAN all his programming and then stick to
> the plan, never improving, never tweaking, and never, never touching
> some other team's code. The lousy young programmer who once worshiped
> him is now his tyrannical boss, a position he got because he played
> golf with some sphincter in a suit. The hive has been ruined.  The best
> coders leave.  And the marketers, comfortable now because they're
> surrounded by power neckties and they have things under control, are
> baffled that each new iteration of their software loses market share
> as the code bloats and the bugs proliferate.  Got to get some better
> packaging.  Yeah, that's it.
